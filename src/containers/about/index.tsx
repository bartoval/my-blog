        <p>
          I spend my whole day, practically every day, working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
          dabbling with Node.js and inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless information through a few hundred RSS feeds.

        <p>
          I'm a Developer focusing on Frontend with some years of experience as a Full Stack.
          My default go-to framework is React but I'm fine with Vue too, however in my opinion having Knowledge about Javascript and Web architectures are more important and give you a flexible mindset.
          I do my best to stay on top of changes in the state of the art so that I can enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ah ok, I also have a MS degree in Computer Engineering... just to find an alternative to Stack Overflow &#128517;.
